# LiterallyString
Makes string literals out of strings. 

Some editors and IDEs, when you paste text into a string literal, automatically escape and format the string for you.

Some don't.

You could find a plugin that makes everything pretty for you. Or you could use this. Maybe the plugin will save you several seconds twice a week and over time you will have hours and hours over the course of your life, but when some バカ makes you use a different IDE or a different editor and you don't have your pretty-ass plugin set up, all your hard work getting your plugin working will have gone to waste.
